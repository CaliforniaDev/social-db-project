    "# The Querying Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Postgres Handles Queries Step by Step:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM users\n",
    "WHERE username = 'Alyson14';\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. **Parser**\n",
    "   - The query is first sent to the **parser**, where it is broken down into a structured format called a **parse tree**.  \n",
    "   - The parser checks for **syntax errors** and validates the SQL query to ensure that it follows the SQL standard.  \n",
    "   - For example, it ensures that `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` are valid SQL keywords, and that `users` is a valid table name in the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rewrite**\n",
    "   - The **query rewriter** takes the parsed query and applies any applicable **rules** or **transformations**.  \n",
    "   - This step involves applying **views**, **rules**, or **triggers** that may modify the query structure.  \n",
    "   - For example, if the query references a view instead of a table, the rewriter replaces the view with its underlying query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Planner**\n",
    "   - The **query planner** (or **optimizer**) generates an **execution plan**.  \n",
    "   - Postgres considers multiple strategies (e.g., **sequential scan**, **index scan**) to determine the most **cost-efficient method** of executing the query.  \n",
    "   - The planner uses the database's **statistics** and **indexes** to estimate costs, such as the number of disk I/O operations and CPU resources required.  \n",
    "   - For instance, if thereâ€™s an index on `username`, the planner may choose an **index scan** over a **sequential scan** to optimize performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Execute**\n",
    "   - The **executor** runs the query based on the chosen plan from the planner.  \n",
    "   - Data is fetched row by row (or in batches) according to the plan's strategy.  \n",
    "   - For example, if an **index scan** is chosen, Postgres uses the index to locate the specific row(s) matching `username = 'Alyson14'`.  \n",
    "   - The results are returned to the client in the format specified by the query (e.g., `SELECT *` returns all columns for the matching row).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Indexes\n",
    "- Use indexes for columns that are frequently queried in **WHERE**, **JOIN**, or **ORDER BY** clauses.  \n",
    "- Avoid adding indexes to columns with a high number of **duplicate values** (low cardinality) unless needed for specific use cases.  \n",
    "- Monitor query performance with `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to identify slow queries that may benefit from indexes.  \n",
    "- Remember that indexes speed up **read operations** but may slow down **write operations** (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Indexes in Postgres\n",
    "1. **B-Tree Indexes**  \n",
    "   - Default index type, ideal for equality and range queries.  \n",
    "2. **Hash Indexes**  \n",
    "   - Optimized for equality comparisons, such as `=` and `!=`.  \n",
    "3. **GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)**  \n",
    "   - Suitable for full-text search and JSONB fields.  \n",
    "4. **GiST (Generalized Search Tree)**  \n",
    "   - Useful for complex queries, such as geometric data.  \n",
    "5. **BRIN (Block Range Index)**  \n",
    "   - Ideal for large, sequentially ordered datasets.\n",

    "# Query Cost Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of a query in PostgreSQL is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost = (# pages read sequentially) * 1.0  \n",
    "     + (# pages read at random) * 4.0  \n",
    "     + (# rows scanned) * 0.01  \n",
    "     + (# index entries scanned) * 0.005  \n",
    "     + (# times function/operator evaluated) * 0.0025\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breakdown of Components:\n",
    "- **Sequential Pages**:  \n",
    "  Pages read sequentially cost `1.0` per page (cheaper than random access).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Pages**:  \n",
    "  Pages read randomly cost `4.0` per page (more expensive than sequential access).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rows Scanned**:  \n",
    "  Each row scanned adds `0.01` to the total cost.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Index Entries Scanned**:  \n",
    "  Each scanned index entry adds `0.005` to the total cost.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function/Operator Evaluation**:  \n",
    "  Each function/operator evaluation adds `0.0025` to the total cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "If a query:\n",
    "- Reads 10 sequential pages,\n",
    "- Reads 2 random pages,\n",
    "- Scans 500 rows,\n",
    "- Scans 200 index entries, and\n",
    "- Evaluates functions/operators 100 times,\n",
    "\n",
    "The total cost would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost = (10 * 1.0) + (2 * 4.0) + (500 * 0.01) + (200 * 0.005) + (100 * 0.0025)  \n",
    "     = 10 + 8 + 5 + 1 + 0.25  \n",
    "     = 24.25\n",
